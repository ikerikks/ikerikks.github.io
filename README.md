# Weather app

Hi everyonne ! This project it's a basic responsive weather app that I built in HTML - CSS - Vanilla JS.\
The display of the weather info it's possible thanks to the [OpenWeather](https://openweathermap.org/) API.

I found inspiration on **codewithsadee**'s youtube channel.\
He propose a tutorial but I reproduce it by myself cloning his starter repo and removing the guide styles md file and some others so I could start from 0.
