# Weather app

Hi everyonne ! This project it's a basic responsive weather app that I built in HTML - CSS - Vanilla JS.\
The display of the weather info it's possible thanks to the **OpenWeather** API.

I found the design inspiration on **codewithsadee**'s youtube channel.\
So I decide to reproduce it by myself adding some animations and interactivity.

Don't hesitate to share your opinion, advices, or problems that you encounter using the app.
